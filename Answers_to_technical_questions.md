1. How long did you spend on the coding test?
   I spent approximately 6 hours on the coding test, covering planning, coding, and testing.

2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language?

One of the most useful recent additions to JavaScript (ES2022) is the Array.prototype.at() method. This method provides a more intuitive way to access elements at specific positions in an array, including support for negative indexing. This feature is particularly helpful when needing to access the last element or a specific position from the end of an array.
This method is particularly useful in applications like task management, where precise object property checks are often required.

3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
   To track down a performance issue in production, I would use the following steps:

Monitoring and Alerts: Set up monitoring and alerts to detect potential performance issues as soon as they arise. Tools like New Relic, Datadog, or server logs are helpful.
Analyze Logs and Metrics: Look at request logs and metrics such as response time, memory usage, and CPU load to pinpoint bottlenecks.
Use Profiling Tools: In a React-based app, tools like React Profiler help in analyzing component re-renders. For backend issues, tools like APMs or Chrome DevTools can isolate slow endpoints.
Database Optimization: Check and optimize database queries, as inefficient queries can lead to performance issues.
Caching and Optimizations: Implement caching for frequently accessed data and analyze resource allocation.
Yes, I have resolved performance issues before, specifically by reducing excessive API calls in a component, which significantly improved load times.

4. If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?
   Given more time, I would add the following features to enhance the application:

User Authentication: Implement user login and registration to allow personalized task management.
Task Prioritization and Sorting: Add drag-and-drop for prioritizing tasks and sorting options (e.g., by due date or priority).
Reminders and Notifications: Include notifications for upcoming tasks or reminders on due dates.
Data Persistence in Cloud: Store tasks in a cloud-based database, such as Firebase or MongoDB Atlas, to allow access across devices.
Improved UX/UI: Optimize the user experience with animations, accessibility improvements, and a mobile-friendly layout.
Recurring Tasks: Enable support for setting recurring tasks, making it easier for users to manage repeating tasks.
These features would improve the user experience and add more value to the application, making it a comprehensive task management tool.
